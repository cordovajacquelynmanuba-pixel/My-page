        <p>Call of duty is the first game I played when I was in junior highschool. I stop playing this game when I was in senior
            highschool because I got busy with my studies. But now that I'm in college I started playing this game again not all 
            the time but when I dont have any pending activities in school. When my friends are inviting me to play with them, I 
            really enjoy playing this game because of its exciting and action-packed gameplay. It allows me to immerse myself in
            thrilling missions and challenges, providing a great way to unwind and have fun with friends. Overall, Call of Duty is
            a fantastic game that combines intense action with strategic gameplay, making it a favorite among gamers worldwide.</p>
